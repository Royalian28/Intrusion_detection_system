U2R (User to Root) attacks: These attacks often involve a normal user account performing actions that are typically reserved for a root user. Therefore, you might see a high hot value, indicating a number of ‘hot’ indicators or suspicious activities. Additionally, if the dataset includes features related to user privileges or system commands, those might also be relevant for detecting U2R attacks.
R2L (Remote to Local) attacks: These attacks often involve an external machine gaining local user access. Therefore, you might see a high src_bytes or dst_bytes value, indicating a large amount of data being sent or received, as the attacker attempts to exploit vulnerabilities or send malicious payloads. Additionally, a high logged_in value might be seen, as the attacker successfully gains access.
a DoS attack might have a high count (number of connections) and serror_rate (rate of “SYN” errors), indicating a flood of traffic causing errors. On the other hand, a Probe attack might have a high diff_srv_rate (rate of connections to different services) and dst_host_same_src_port_rate (rate of connections to the same source port on the current host), indicating a scanning of different services and ports.
